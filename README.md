# Password Generator
The purpose of the application is to create a randomly generated password based on the user's criteria. The user will be prompted to enter a desired length of a password, as well as if they wish to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. Once the user gives the required information, a password will randomly be generated based on the user's input. 

The starter code was downloaded from an existing repository on GitHub.
